# Vision statement
For consumers who need to keep track of a busy schedule, the Online Event Planner is a calendar application that will allow users to input upcoming events and provide additional information related to them as well as display them in an easy to access manner. This application will allow users to save time by keeping track of their events and allowing the user to immediately gain information about the viability of their schedule. Unlike other calendar applications, our product will allow for audio input for creation and management of events and interpret information within events to provide insights.

# Reason for doing this project
